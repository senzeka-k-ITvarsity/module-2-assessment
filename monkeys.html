                            <h3>MONKEY</h3>
    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to certain groups or species of simian mammals of infraorder Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys.Kingdom: Animalia
Order: Primates
Class: Mammalia
Phylum: Chordata
Infraorder: Simiiformes;
Lifespan: Mandrill: 20 years, Lion-tailed macaque: 20 years</p>
     <p>Monkeys live in trees, grasslands, mountains, forests, and on high plains. A group of monkeys is called a troop. Most primates share six basic features: forward-facing eyes, eye sockets, grasping hands, nails, fingerprints, and large brains. Monkeys are most easily distinguished from apes by their tails.</p>
   <p>Vervet monkeys occur throughout Africa, from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east and all the way down south to the Western Cape in South Africa. Vervet monkeys occur in a wide variety of woodland and open savannah, where they are dependent on water availability and trees for food and cover.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Monkeys tend to inhabit the tropical rainforests of Africa, Central America, South America and Asia. All primates live in trees, with the exception of baboons that prefer to live on the ground.</p>
