                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies. Scientific name: Oryx gazella
Height: 1,2 m (At Shoulder)
Speed: 60 km/h (Maximum, Running)
Family: Bovidae
Kingdom: Animalia
Mass: Male: 220 – 300 kg, Female: 100 – 210 kg</p>
     <p>The herds move to different areas as the seasons change in search of water and food. It is generally the female, or cow, that leads the search for water and food, with the dominant or alpha male bringing up the rear. Gemsbok can reach running speeds of up to 35 mph.</p>
   <p>A young gemsbok’s horns grow extremely fast during the concealment period, and therefore it is easy to understand the myth that a gemsbok is born with horns. Females can mate again a few weeks after calving.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>At Fossil Rim, gemsbok live in the Main Pasture - the third pasture you enter.</p>
