                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.The giraffe is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.Eats: Acacia
Height: Northern giraffe: 4,6 – 6,1 m
Mass: Northern giraffe: 800 kg Encyclopedia of Life
Gestation period: Northern giraffe: 15 months
Speed: 60 km/h (Maximum, Sprint)
Family: Giraffidae</p>
     <p>Physically, giraffes are quiet, extremely tall, have excellent eyesight and are considered very intelligent. The intelligence of giraffes is a factor in how quickly they adapt behaviourally in response to changing external stimuli. ... A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground.</p>
   <p>Leopards, hyenas, and wild dogs are other predatory carnivores that are a serious threat to giraffes, especially for newborns or very young who do not have the height, size, strength and experience needed to defend themselves.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Giraffes live primarily in savanna areas in the sub-Saharan region of Africa.</p>
