                       <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>
                       <p>Lost Forest is a remnant of an ancient ponderosa pine forest that covered much of central Oregon thousands of years ago, when the climate was cooler and wetter. Today, the Lost Forest pines survive on half the annual precipitation normally required for their species.</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>To quickest to get to The Lost Woods is from Woodland Tower. Of course, once you get to the top of Woodland Tower, you realize that there is a giant stone skull obscuring the top of the tower, making it impossible to glide into the woods from there.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                      <p>The Lost Forest isn't hard to find â€” it's just hard to see. Tucked in among the trees and rocks at Elk Camp on Snowmass are an alpine coaster, biking trails</p>
