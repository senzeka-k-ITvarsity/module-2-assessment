                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>The common warthog is a wild member of the pig family found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa. In the past, it was commonly treated as a subspecies of P. aethiopicus, but today that scientific name is restricted to the desert warthog of northern Kenya, Somalia, and eastern Ethiopia.Trophic level: Herbivorous Encyclopedia of Life
Species: P. africanus
Family: Suidae
Order: Artiodactyla
Genus: Phacochoerus
Mass: Male: 60 – 150 kg (Adult), Female: 45 – 75 kg (Adult)</p>
     <p>These charismatic creatures are the epitome of an African safari here at Shamwari. Their scientific name is Phacochoerus Africanus also known as the common warthog. Their name comes from their 'warts' or protrusions on the sides of their face, these protrusions are a combination of bone and cartilage.</p>
   <p>Warthogs, as one might guess from the name, are members of the Swine family and are related to pigs, boars and hogs. And as the name also suggests, warthogs have patches on their faces that look like warts, but are just thick growths of skin. These patches act as padding for when males fight during mating season.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Home, sweet aardvark hole: Warthogs live in Africa's southern Sudan and southwestern Ethiopia, in savanna woodland and grasslands—and they are not picky about their homes. Instead of digging their own burrows, they find abandoned aardvark holes or natural burrows for homes.</p>
