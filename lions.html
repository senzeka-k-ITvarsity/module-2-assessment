                            <h3>LION</h3>
    <p>Lions have disappeared from North Africa and southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru.The lion is a large felid of the genus Panthera native mainly to Africa. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane. Speed: 80 km/h (Maximum, In Short Bursts)
Scientific name: Panthera leo
Conservation status: Vulnerable (Population decreasing)
Lifespan: Female: 10 – 15 years (Adult, In the wild), Male: 8 – 10 years (Adult, In the wild)
Mass: Male: 190 kg (Adult), Female: 130 kg (Adult)
Height: Male: 1,2 m (Adult, At Shoulder), Female: 1,1 m (Adult, At Shoulder)</p>
     <p>Lions are the only cats that live in groups. A group, or pride, can be up to 30 lions, depending on how much food and water is available. Female lions are the main hunters. While they're out looking for food, the males guard the pride's territory and their young.</p>
   <p>The lion has forever been a symbol of strength, power and ferocity. During WWF tours to Africa, seeing the majestic species up-close is sure to be a spine-tingling experience. 10. African lions are the most social of all big cats and live together in groups or “prides.” A pride consists of about 15 lions.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, below the Sahara Desert, but one small population exists around Gir Forest National Park in western India. Lions in west and central Africa are more closely related to these Asiatic lions in India, than to those found in southern and east Africa.</p>
