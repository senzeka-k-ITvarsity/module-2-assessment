    <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates. Lifespan: 35 – 40 years
Height: Western gorilla: 1,6 m
Genus: Gorilla; I. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1852
Family: Hominidae
Mass: Western gorilla: 160 kg, Eastern gorilla: 140 – 210 kg
Speed: Western gorilla: 40 km/h, Eastern gorilla: 40 km/h</p>
     <p>Gorillas have hands and feet like humans including opposable thumbs and big toes. ... In each troop there is one dominant male Silverback, some female gorillas, and their offspring. Gorillas live around 35 years. They can live longer, up to 50 years, in captivity.</p>
   <p>Gorillas primarily inhabit tropical forest habitats. ... Lowland areas of tropical forests usually have a prolonged dry season and usually consist of thorny shrubs, trees, and succulents (plants that are able to store water in their cells).</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Eastern gorillas live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Uganda and Rwanda. Whereas western gorillas can be found in Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Angola and DRC.</p>
