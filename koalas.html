                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family Vombatidae.Lifespan: 13 â€“ 18 years (In the wild)
Species: P. cinereus
Family: Phascolarctidae
Genus: Phascolarctos
Kingdom: Animalia
Order: Diprotodontia</p>
     <p>Koalas have special physical characteristics that complement their tree-dwelling lifestyle. With two opposable digits, their forepaws are well-adapted to gripping branches and picking eucalyptus leaves, their main form of nourishment. ... Koalas also have special adaptations that enable them to feast on eucalyptus leaves.</p>
   <p>Mostly active at night, with their sharp claws and opposable digits, Koalas are most at home high in the tree canopy and come down to ground only to move trees or to another habitat patch. They get all the moisture they need from gum leaves and only need water in times of drought (when leaves dry out).</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Koalas live in the eucalyptus forests of southeastern and eastern Australia. When not sleeping, they're usually eating. They rely on the eucalyptus tree for both habitat and food.</p>
